# autokitteh

autokitteh is an open-source platform for developing and managing automated,
reliable, durable, long-running workflows with simple tools and familiar
languages.

It is a developer-first alternative to no-code/low-code platforms (such as Zapier, make.com, etc.) and a durable execution platform (a complement to Temporal). It offers tools and a simplified abstraction for crafting reliable, long-running workflows without sacrificing the power and flexibility of direct code manipulation.

autokitteh promotes a developer-first approach, catering to both inexperienced
beginners and busy experts, with a wide variety of skill sets and use cases:

- CI/CD pipelines and DevOps processes
- Infrastructure and backend systems orchestration
- IT, ops, and cybersecurity SOAR runbooks
- Cross-system syncs and integrations
- Sales, marketing, and back-office automations

autokitteh hides away the toil and provides advanced engineering features
out-of-the-box:

- Secure, seamless, bidirectional API integration
- User-friendly management, monitoring, and debugging
- Standalone and distributed system reliability
- Automated recovery without state loss
- Built-in durability for long-running workflows
- Readiness for world-class scalability needs
- Versatile deployment strategies
