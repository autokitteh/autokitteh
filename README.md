AutoKitteh is a **developer** platform for workflow automation and
orchestration. It is an easy-to-use, code-based alternative to no/low-code
platforms (such as Zapier, Workato, Make.com, n8n) with unlimited flexibility.

**You write in vanilla Python, we make it durable** ðŸª„

In addition, it is a **durable execution** platform for long-running and
reliable workflows. It is based on [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), hiding
many of its infrastructure and coding complexities.

AutoKitteh can be self-hosted, and has a cloud offering as well.

Once installed, AutoKitteh is a scalable "serverless" platform (with batteries
included) for DevOps, FinOps, MLOps, SOAR, productivity tasks, critical
backend business processes, and more.

## High-Level Architecture

![Architecture diagram](/docs/images/architecture.png)

**Platform:** A scalable server that provides interfaces for building projects
(workflows), deploying them, triggering the code with webhooks or schedulers,
executing the code as durable workflows, and managing these workflows.

**API:** AutoKitteh is an API-first platform. All services are available via
gRPC / HTTP.

**Built-in integrations:** Slack, GitHub, Twilio, ChatGPT, Gemini, Gmail,
Google Calendar, HTTP, gRPC and many more. It's easy to add new integrations.

**Supported programming languages:** Python, Starlark (a dialect of Python),
and JavaScript (coming soon).
