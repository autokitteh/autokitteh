See https://docs.autokitteh.com/develop/python/#function-arguments-and-return-values-must-be-pickleable
for more details.

-- main.py:main --
from threading import Lock

def main(event):
    lock = Lock()
    with lock:
        print('locked')
    print('unlocked')

# This should fail, which is OK since you can't pickle Lock objects
