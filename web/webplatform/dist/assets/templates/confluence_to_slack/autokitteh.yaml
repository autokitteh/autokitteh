# This YAML file is a declarative manifest that describes the setup of
# an AutoKitteh project that announces new Confluence pages in Slack.
#
# Before deploying this AutoKitteh project:
# - Set the "CONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEY" in the trigger's filter expression
# - Set "FILTER_LABEL" for event filtering during runtime
#   ("" = disable this runtime check)
# - Set "SLACK_CHANNEL" to the Slack channel name/ID you want to post to
#
# After creating this AutoKitteh project by applying this file,
# initialize its Confluence and Slack connections.
