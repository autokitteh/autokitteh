# This YAML file is a declarative manifest that describes the setup of
# an AutoKitteh project that sets the assignee of new Atlassian Jira
# issues based on an on-call rotation in a shared Google Calendar.
#
# Before deploying this AutoKitteh project:
# - Set "SHARED_CALENDAR_ID" to the URL of the shared Google Calendar
#   ("primary" is the default calendar of the authenticated user)
# - Set "JIRA_PROJECT_KEY" in the trigger's filter expression
#
# After creating this AutoKitteh project by applying this file,
# initialize its Jira connection.
